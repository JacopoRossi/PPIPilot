I give you in input: an event log, a list of activities, a list of variants of the event log, a description of the event log, and the name of the activity that I want to be the subject of Process Performance Indicators. This is a FALLBACK ANALYSIS to discover alternative and innovative time-based PPIs.

event log: ```{}```

list of activities: ```{}``` 

list of variants: ```{}``` 

description of the event log: ```{}``` 

the goal: ```{}``` 

subject activity of the event log: ```{}```

FALLBACK ANALYSIS APPROACH:
This analysis focuses on discovering innovative time-based Process Performance Indicators using alternative methodologies:

1) CROSS-ACTIVITY DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS:
   - Analyze how the timing of the subject activity affects other activities
   - Identify bottlenecks and waiting times caused by or affecting the subject activity
   - Discover cascading timing effects throughout the process

2) PROCESS FLOW OPTIMIZATION METRICS:
   - Identify timing patterns that indicate process inefficiencies
   - Discover metrics for parallel execution opportunities
   - Find timing indicators for process optimization potential

3) PREDICTIVE TIMING INDICATORS:
   - Metrics that can predict future timing issues
   - Early warning indicators based on timing patterns
   - Trend analysis for timing performance degradation

4) RESOURCE AND WORKLOAD TIMING ANALYSIS:
   - Time-based metrics related to resource utilization
   - Workload distribution timing patterns
   - Peak and off-peak timing performance indicators

5) QUALITY AND COMPLIANCE TIMING METRICS:
   - Time-based indicators of quality issues
   - Compliance-related timing requirements
   - SLA and deadline adherence metrics

Now You can follow these steps:
1) Analyze the event log with focus on alternative timing perspectives
2) Based on the FALLBACK ANALYSIS APPROACH, discover innovative time-based Process Performance Indicators for the subject activity. Requirements:
   a) Focus on cross-activity relationships and dependencies
   b) Discover timing metrics that reveal process bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
   c) Create predictive and trend-based timing indicators
   d) Consider resource utilization and workload timing patterns
   e) Include quality and compliance timing metrics
   f) Use specific activity names from the event log, not generic terms
   g) Consider the organizational goal and process variants
   h) Provide metrics that complement traditional duration measurements
3) In the response give me the list of innovative PPIs, without adding more information, following this format: 
   'subject activity name (Alternative Analysis):
   1) PPI 1
   2) PPI 2
   ... '
