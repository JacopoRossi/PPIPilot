I give you in input: an event log, a list of activities, a list of variants of the event log, a description of the event log, and the name of the activity that I want to be the subject of Process Performance Indicators. This is a FALLBACK ANALYSIS to discover alternative and innovative frequency/percentage-based PPIs.

event log: ```{}```

list of activities: ```{}``` 

list of variants: ```{}``` 

description of the event log: ```{}``` 

the goal: ```{}``` 

subject activity of the event log: ```{}```

FALLBACK ANALYSIS APPROACH:
This analysis focuses on discovering innovative frequency and percentage-based Process Performance Indicators using alternative methodologies:

1) PROCESS PATTERN ANALYSIS:
   - Analyze frequency patterns that indicate process health
   - Discover occurrence ratios that reveal process bottlenecks
   - Identify frequency-based indicators of process variants effectiveness

2) BEHAVIORAL AND TREND ANALYSIS:
   - Frequency metrics that indicate changing process behavior
   - Occurrence patterns that predict future process issues
   - Trend-based frequency indicators for process evolution

3) EXCEPTION AND ANOMALY DETECTION:
   - Frequency-based metrics for identifying process exceptions
   - Occurrence ratios that highlight unusual process behavior
   - Percentage indicators for process deviation detection

4) RESOURCE AND WORKLOAD DISTRIBUTION:
   - Frequency metrics related to resource utilization patterns
   - Occurrence ratios for workload distribution analysis
   - Percentage indicators for capacity planning

5) QUALITY AND COMPLIANCE FREQUENCY METRICS:
   - Occurrence-based indicators of quality issues
   - Frequency metrics for compliance monitoring
   - Percentage indicators for process adherence

6) PROCESS OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:
   - Frequency metrics that identify improvement opportunities
   - Occurrence ratios for process streamlining
   - Percentage indicators for efficiency enhancement

Now You can follow these steps:
1) Analyze the event log with focus on alternative frequency and percentage perspectives
2) Based on the FALLBACK ANALYSIS APPROACH, discover innovative frequency/percentage-based Process Performance Indicators for the subject activity. Requirements:
   a) Focus on process patterns and behavioral analysis
   b) Discover frequency metrics that reveal process optimization opportunities
   c) Create predictive and trend-based occurrence indicators
   d) Consider resource utilization and workload distribution patterns
   e) Include quality, compliance, and exception detection metrics
   f) Use specific activity names from the event log, not generic terms
   g) Consider the organizational goal and process variants
   h) Provide metrics that complement traditional frequency measurements
3) In the response give me the list of innovative PPIs, without adding more information, following this format: 
   'subject activity name (Alternative Analysis):
   1) PPI 1
   2) PPI 2
   ... '
