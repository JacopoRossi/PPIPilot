I give you in input a list of Process Performance Indicators, the list of activities of the event log and the list of attributes of the event log.

List of Process Performance Indicators: ```{}``` 

list of activities of the event log: ```{}``` 

list of attributes of the event log: ```{}``` 

Now you have to rewrite the Process Performance Indicators to be compatible with these examples. In particular, I want the Process Performance Indicator to be written in JSON format following this structure:
      [
        "begin": "activity == NAME OF ACTIVITY OF THE LOG",
        "end": "activity == NAME OF ACTIVITY OF THE LOG",
        "metric_condition": "> alfanumeric_metric_value" or "< alfanumeric_metric_value" or "== alfanumeric_metric_value" or "!= alfanumeric_metric_value"
        "aggregation": "average" or "total" or "percentage" or "minimum" or "maximum"
        "group_by": "a value from list of attributes of the event log  or a value related to year, month, day or week"
        "filter": "take a value from list of attributes of the event log, then compare it with an alfanumeric_metric_value"
      ]

You must follow this considerations:
a) "begin" field has to be a name from the list of activities of the event log
b) "end" field has to be a name from the list of activities of the event log
c) "metric_condition" field is referred to a comparison that we have respect to the "begin" field and the "end" field
d) "aggregation" field has to be a value between "average","total","percentage","minimum","maximum"
e) "group_by" field has to be a value from the list of attributes of the event log
f) "filter" field specify a filter condition where the first term of comparison must be always a value from the list of attributes
g) "filter" field can not include expressions like: 'preceding_activity', 'following_activity', 'related_activity'
h) Don't add comment to the translation
i) Don't use 'AND', 'OR', 'and','or' condition

Now I give you some example of how translate a Process Performance Indicator:

    "PPI name": "Average time from 'Engine Installation' to 'Electrical Systems Checking' with a consumption bigger than 100",
    "PPI json": [
      "begin": "activity == 'Engine Installation'",
      "end": "activity == 'Electrical Systems Checking'",
      "aggregation": "average",
      "filter": "case:Consumption > 100"
    ]

    "PPI name": "Total time from 'Chassis Assembly Initiated' to 'Electrical Systems Checking' in cases where 'Custom Interior Fittings' occurs",
    "PPI json": [
      "begin": "activity == 'Chassis Assembly Initiated'",
      "end": "activity == 'Electrical Systems Checking'",
      "aggregation": "total",
      "filter": "activity == 'Custom Interior Fittings'"
    ]
    
    "PPI name": "Total time for 'Custom Interior Fittings' activity",
    "PPI json": [
      "begin": "activity == 'Custom Interior Fittings'",
      "end": "",
      "aggregation": "total"
    ]

    "PPI name": "Average time from 'Engine Installation' to 'Tire Mounting' grouped by case:resourceNumber",
    "PPI json": [
      "begin": "activity == 'Engine Installation'",
      "end": "activity == 'Tire Mounting'",
      "aggregation": "average",
      "group_by": "case:resourceNumber",
    ]

    "PPI name": "Minimum time from 'Engine Installation' to 'Tire Mounting'",
    "PPI json": [
      "begin": "activity == 'Engine Installation'",
      "end": "activity == 'Tire Mounting'",
      "aggregation": "minimum",
    ]

    "PPI name": "Total time for Vehicle Testing in cases without Tire Mounting",
    "PPI json": [
      "begin": "activity == 'Vehicle Testing'",
      "end": "",
      "aggregation": "total",
      "filter": "activity != 'Tire Mounting'"
    ]


You have to translate all the PPIs in the list you have in input.
In the result I want the name of the original PPI and its translation. Follow this structure:
'
{{
    "PPIname": "[write the PPI name]",
    "PPIjson": {{
        "begin": "[write the begin field]",
        "end": "[write the end field]",
        "aggregation": "[write the aggregation field]",
        "filter": "[write the filter field]",
        "group_by": "[write the group_by field]",
    }}
}}'
