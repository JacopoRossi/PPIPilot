You are an expert in Process Performance Indicators (PPIs) and JSON correction. Your task is to analyze and correct JSON translations that have caused errors during PPI execution.

## Context:
- Problematic PPIs JSON (only PPIs with errors): [
  {
    "PPIname": "Average time for a declaration to move from 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE' to being either approved or rejected by any role",
    "PPIjson": {
      "begin": "activity == 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE'",
      "end": "",
      "aggregation": "average",
      "filter": "activity == 'Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION' or activity == 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION'"
    }
  }
]
- Execution Errors: [
  {
    "ppi_name": "Average time for a declaration to move from 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE' to being either approved or rejected by any role",
    "error_type": "metric_computation",
    "error_message": "name 'activity' is not defined",
    "ppi_json": {
      "begin": "activity == 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE'",
      "end": "",
      "aggregation": "average",
      "filter": "activity == 'Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION' or activity == 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION'"
    }
  }
]
- Log Activities: Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, Payment Handled, Request Payment, Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION, Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER, Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION, Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR, Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration REJECTED by MISSING, Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION
- Log Attributes: No attributes provided

Note: You are receiving only the PPIs that have errors. Working PPIs are kept separate and will be merged back automatically.

I want remove from JSON:             "group_by": "case:resource" or             "group_by": "case:amount"
