You are an expert in Process Performance Indicators (PPIs) and JSON correction. Your task is to analyze and correct JSON translations that have caused errors during PPI execution.

## Context:
- Original JSON: [
  {
    "PPIname": "Average time for a declaration to move from 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE' to being either approved or rejected by any role",
    "PPIjson": {
      "begin": "activity == 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE'",
      "end": "",
      "aggregation": "average",
      "filter": "activity == 'Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION' or activity == 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION'"
    }
  }
]
- Execution Errors: [
  {
    "ppi_name": "Average time for a declaration to move from 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE' to being either approved or rejected by any role",
    "error_type": "metric_computation",
    "error_message": "name 'activity' is not defined",
    "ppi_json": {
      "begin": "activity == 'Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE'",
      "end": "",
      "aggregation": "average",
      "filter": "activity == 'Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION' or activity == 'Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION'"
    }
  }
]
- Log Activities: Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, Payment Handled, Request Payment, Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION, Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER, Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION, Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR, Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration REJECTED by MISSING, Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION
- Log Attributes: No attributes provided

## Your Task:
Analyze the provided JSON and errors, then generate a corrected JSON that will execute successfully. 

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Only use activity names that exist in the log: Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, Payment Handled, Request Payment, Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION, Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER, Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION, Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR, Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration REJECTED by MISSING, Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION
- Only use attribute names that exist in the log: No attributes provided
- PRESERVE the original PPI JSON structures as much as possible - only fix syntax and validation errors
- Do NOT change the logic or intent of each PPI, only fix technical errors
- Each PPI should maintain its unique structure and purpose

Focus on:

1. **Syntax Issues**: Fix any JSON formatting problems, missing quotes, brackets, or commas
2. **Field Validation**: Ensure all required fields are present and correctly formatted
3. **Activity Names**: Verify activity names match those available in the log
4. **Attribute Names**: Ensure attribute references are valid
5. **Logical Expressions**: Fix filter conditions and metric expressions
6. **Data Types**: Ensure values have correct data types (strings, numbers, booleans)

## Common Error Patterns to Fix:
- Missing or incorrect quotes around strings
- Invalid activity names that don't exist in the log (use only activities from: Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, Payment Handled, Request Payment, Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION, Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER, Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION, Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR, Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration REJECTED by MISSING, Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION)
- Malformed filter expressions
- Incorrect aggregation functions (use: average, total, minimum, maximum)
- Missing required fields like "count", "begin", "end"
- Invalid metric_condition expressions
- Incorrect group_by or filter syntax
- Invalid attribute names (use only attributes from: No attributes provided)
- Empty begin/end fields should have proper activity references or be removed
- Escaped quotes (\\) should be removed
- Non-existent columns like 'quickest_approval_variant', 'case:org:resource', 'case:outcome'

## Output Format:
Return ONLY the corrected JSON array in the exact same structure as the input, with all errors fixed. Do not include any explanations, markdown formatting, or additional text.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Start your response immediately with the opening bracket `[`
- End your response with the closing bracket `]`
- Use proper JSON formatting with double quotes for all strings
- Do not include any text before or after the JSON
- Do not wrap the JSON in markdown code blocks
- Remove parameter line from the JSON if no valid column exists, for example with the error: KeyError: 'Column not found: case:resource', you can simply remove the line


I give you an example, with:

 {{
    "ppi_name": "Average time for 'Request Payment' across different organizational resources",
    "error_type": "metric_computation",
    "error_message": "'Column not found: case:resource'",
    "ppi_json": {{
      "begin": "activity == 'Request Payment'",
      "end": "",
      "aggregation": "average",
      "group_by": "case:resource"
    }}
 }},

 I want the json to remove the error line so to became:
  {{
    "ppi_name": "Average time for 'Request Payment' across different organizational resources",
    "ppi_json": {{
      "begin": "activity == 'Request Payment'",
      "end": "",
      "aggregation": "average",
    }}
 }},



 
Example structure for PPIs refering to time:
[
    {{
        "PPIname": "[write the PPI name]",
        "PPIjson": {{
            "begin": "[write the begin field]",
            "end": "[write the end field]",
            "aggregation": "[write the aggregation field]",
            "filter": "[write the filter field]",
            "group_by": "[write the group_by field]",
        }}
    }}
]


Example structure for PPIs refering to occurency and percentage:
[
    {{
        "PPIname": "Corrected PPI Name",
        "PPIjson": {{
            "count": "[write the count field]",
            "metric_condition": "[write the metric_condition field]",
            "aggregation": "[write the aggregation field]",
            "filter": "[write the filter field]",
            "group_by": "[write the group_by field]",
        }}
    }}
]
