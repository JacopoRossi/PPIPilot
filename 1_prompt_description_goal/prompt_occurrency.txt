I give you in input: an event log, a list of activities, a list of variants of the event log, the definition of 'percentage' and 'frequency', a list of parametrized Process Performance Indicators that analyzes the 'percentage' and 'frequency', and the name of the activity that I want to be the subject of Process Performance Indicators.

event log: ```{}```

list of activities: ```{}``` 

list of variants: ```{}``` 

description of the event log: ```{}``` 

'percentage': is the ratio between the number of time an activity <ACT> occurs out of the total number of activity executions.
'frequency': indicate the number of time an activity <ACT> occurs or a path between two different activities <ACT1> and <ACT2> occurs.

List of parametrized Process Performance Indicators:
1) Percentage of <ACT1> before <ACT2>
2) Number of <ACT>
3) Percentage of <ACT1> out of all <ACT2>
4) Number of <ACT1> that are preceded by <ACT2>
5) Percentage of <ACT> that are not dismissed
6) Percentage of <ACT1> from all <ACT2>
7) Number of <ACT> with amounts above 100 euros
8) Percentage of <ACT> by <RESOURCE>
9) Number of <ACT> grouped by <COLUMN>
10) Percentage of <ACT> by worker
11) Percentage of <ACT1> followed by <ACT2>
12) Number of <ACT> made per year
13) Percentage of <ACT> that are rejected
14) Number of <ACT1> in relation to <ACT2>
15) Percentage of <ACT>
16) Number of times <ACT> is performed
17) Percentage of <ACT1> done after <ACT2>
18) Average number of <ACT>
19) Percentage of <ACT> with an increment
20) Percentage of <ACT> with appeal
21) Average number of <ACT1> that are followed by <ACT2>
22) Percentage of <ACT> with penalty
23) Average number of <ACT> in a month
24) Total <ACT> done by <RESOURCE>
25) Fraction of <ACT> that are dismissed
26) Total <ACT> performed by <RESOURCE>
27) Ratio of <ACT1> over <ACT2>
28) Occasions how often the <ACT> is performed 
29) The ratio of <ACT> that are not eventually performed

the goal: ```{}``` 

subject activity of the event log: ```{}```

Now You can follow these steps:
1) Analyzes the event log
2) Based on the list of parametrized Process Performance Indicators discover a new list of Process Performance Indicators for the subject activity of the event log in input. To do this action you have to satisfy these requirements:
    a) Don't simply replace the placeholders with the name of the activity
    b) Discover other Process Performance Indicators focusing on 'percentage' or 'frequency' and also on comparing the 'percentage' or 'frequency' of the input subject activity with the 'percentage' or 'frequency' of the others activity of the event log.
    c) Discover Process Performance Indicators that consider the list of variants. 
    d) Discover Process Performance Indicators that consider description of the event log. 
    e) Discover Process Performance Indicators that consider the goal.
    f) Don't say 'Other Activities' but specify the name of an activity.
    g) I don't want only Process Performance Indicators with comparison but I want also Process Performance Indicators referring to the subject activity of the event log.
    h) In the list you must use the the entire name of the activity of the event log I give in input. As example if I give tou in input the activity 'Refuted + Test data' you must use 'Refuted + Test data' in the PPI
3) In the response give me the list of PPIs, without adding more information, following this format: 
    'subject activity name:
    1) PPI 1
    2) PPI 2
    ... '
