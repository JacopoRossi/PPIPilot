You are an expert in Process Performance Indicators (PPIs) and JSON correction. Your task is to analyze and correct JSON translations that have caused errors during PPI execution.

## Context:
- Original JSON: [
  {
    "PPIname": "Average time from 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR' to 'Request Payment'",
    "PPIjson": {
      "begin": "activity == 'Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR'",
      "end": "activity == 'Request Payment'",
      "aggregation": "average"
    }
  },
  {
    "PPIname": "Total time from 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE' to 'Request Payment'",
    "PPIjson": {
      "begin": "activity == 'Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE'",
      "end": "activity == 'Request Payment'",

    }
  },
  {

    "PPIjson": {
      "begin": "activity == 'Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION'",
      "end": "activity == 'Request Payment'",

    "PPIjson": {

- Execution Errors: [
  {
    "ppi_name": "Average time for 'Request Payment' across different organizational resources",
    "error_type": "metric_computation",
    "error_message": "'Column not found: case:resource'",
    "ppi_json": {

      "end": "",
      "aggregation": "minimum",
      "group_by": "case:amount"
    }
  }
]
- Log Activities: Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, Payment Handled, Request Payment, Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION, Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER, Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION, Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR, Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration REJECTED by MISSING, Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION
- Log Attributes: No attributes provided

## Your Task:
Analyze the provided JSON and errors, then generate a corrected JSON that will execute successfully. 

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Only use activity names that exist in the log: Declaration SUBMITTED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration FINAL_APPROVED by SUPERVISOR, Payment Handled, Request Payment, Declaration APPROVED by ADMINISTRATION, Declaration APPROVED by BUDGET OWNER, Declaration REJECTED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration REJECTED by ADMINISTRATION, Declaration APPROVED by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration REJECTED by SUPERVISOR, Declaration SAVED by EMPLOYEE, Declaration REJECTED by MISSING, Declaration REJECTED by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration REJECTED by BUDGET OWNER, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by SUPERVISOR, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by PRE_APPROVER, Declaration FOR_APPROVAL by ADMINISTRATION
- Only use attribute names that exist in the log: No attributes provided
- PRESERVE the original PPI JSON structures as much as possible - only fix syntax and validation errors
- Do NOT change the logic or intent of each PPI, only fix technical errors
- Each PPI should maintain its unique structure and purpose


## Common Fixes Required:
1. **Column not found errors**: Remove the problematic parameter entirely
   - If `group_by` references non-existent column → Remove `group_by` line
   - If `filter` references non-existent column → Remove `filter` line
2. **Invalid filter conditions**: Remove filters that reference non-existent attributes
3. **Preserve all working PPIs**: Keep PPIs that don't have errors unchanged

## Output Format:
Return ONLY the corrected JSON array, with all errors fixed. Do not include any explanations.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Start your response immediately with the opening bracket `[`
- End your response with the closing bracket `]`
- Use proper JSON formatting with double quotes for all strings
- Do not include any text before or after the JSON
- Do not wrap the JSON in markdown code blocks
- Remove parameter line from the JSON if no valid column exists, for example with the error: KeyError: 'Column not found: case:resource', you can simply remove the line
- Remove trailing commas after removing parameters


I give you an example, with:

 {{
    "ppi_name": "Average time for 'Request Payment' across different organizational resources",
    "error_type": "metric_computation",
    "error_message": "'Column not found: case:resource'",
    "ppi_json": {{
      "begin": "activity == 'Request Payment'",
      "end": "",
      "aggregation": "average",
      "group_by": "case:resource"
    }}
 }},

 I want the jso to remove the error line so to became:
  {{
    "ppi_name": "Average time for 'Request Payment' across different organizational resources",
    "ppi_json": {{
      "begin": "activity == 'Request Payment'",
      "end": "",
      "aggregation": "average",
    }}
 }},


Example structure for PPIs refering to time:
[
    {{
        "PPIname": "[write the PPI name]",
        "PPIjson": {{
            "begin": "[write the begin field]",
            "end": "[write the end field]",
            "aggregation": "[write the aggregation field]",
            "filter": "[write the filter field]",
            "group_by": "[write the group_by field]",
        }}
    }}
]


Example structure for PPIs refering to occurency and percentage:
[
    {{
        "PPIname": "Corrected PPI Name",
        "PPIjson": {{
            "count": "[write the count field]",
            "metric_condition": "[write the metric_condition field]",
            "aggregation": "[write the aggregation field]",
            "filter": "[write the filter field]",
            "group_by": "[write the group_by field]",
        }}
    }}
]
